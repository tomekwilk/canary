# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: I could not get Graphana queries to work. Not sure if this is a problem with Prometheus deployment. I was able to login to Graphana and could see /metrics data just fine.
  suggested_improvements: Instructions how to use Prometheus could be a little more detailed.
